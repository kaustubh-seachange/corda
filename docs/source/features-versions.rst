Corda Features to Versions
==========================

New versions of Corda introduce new features. These fall into one of three categories which have subtle but important implications for
node owners, application developers and network operators.

The first set are changes that have no impact on application developers or the Corda network protocol. An example would be support for
a new HSM or database system, for example, and which are of interest only to a node's operator.

The second set are new or changed APIs, which are of interest to CorDapp developers. When a release of Corda ships such features, the
Platform Version of that node is incremented so that a CorDapp that relies on such a new or changed feature can detect this (eg to
prevent it from running on a node without the feature or to trigger an alternative optimised codepath if the feature is present). The
app developer should set the CorDapp's minimumPlatformVersion parameter to signal the minimum Platform Version against which the app
can run or has been tested. If the application has also been tested against a greater platform version and can exploit it if present,
the node can also set the targetPlatformVersion field.

The third set of changes are those which could affect the operation of a Corda network. Examples would include a change to the
serialisation format or flow/wire protocol, or introduction of a new transaction component.  These are changes to the core data model and
these features have the property that it is not safe for any node or application to take advantage of until all nodes on the network
are capable of understanding them. Such features are thus only enabled in a node if the network to which it is connected has published
a minimumPlatformVersion in its network parameters that is greater than or equal to the Corda Platform Version that introduced the
feature. For example, Corda 4.0 nodes, which implement Corda Platform Version 4, can only take advantage of the Corda Reference States
feature when connected to a network with mPV 4.

Generally the rules work this way:

- IF (CorDapp.mPV > node.PV) THEN
    prevent the CorDapp from running (this signals that it cannot run without the new feature).
- IF (CorDapp.mPV <= node.PV AND CorDapp.targetPV < node.PV) THEN
    this means the node is ahead of the CorDapp so it might choose to trigger some code paths that emulate some old behaviour that the
    CorDapp expected on that version.
- IF (CorDapp.mPV <= node.PV AND CorDapp.targetPV == node.PV) THEN
    just use the new mechanism because the CorDapp and the node are perfectly aligned.
- IF (CorDapp.mPV <= node.PV AND CorDapp.targetPV > node.PV) THEN
    this means that the CorDapp is ahead of the running node, but it must have some alternative runtime code paths built in to be able
    to simulate the new behaviour using old apis.
